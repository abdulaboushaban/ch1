  <p>My favorite drink is the Strawberries and Creme Frap from Starbucks. 
    It's got this amazing strawberry flavor and a smooth texture.
Overall, it is a super refreshing drink i can have at any time of the day. 
The whip cream on top is so good by itself. I look forward to drinking it once or twice every week. </p>
